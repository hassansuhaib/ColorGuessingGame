**The idea of this game was taken from Colt Steel's Bootcamp at Udemy.**

**My game also generates random messages upon winning**

A color guessing game which generates random colors and gives you an RGB value and you have to guess which color appears to have that RGB value. There are two modes: Easy and Hard.

I am making it just to practice my JavaScript and CSS skills.
